Undo functionality will allow a user to remove specific transactions.
Removing a transaction should be able to be done by simply clicking
on the respective row. Once a row is clicked on, the transaction will
be removed from the transaction list, and total cost will be updated,
alongside the view of all the transactions being refreshed.

This will include necessary changes to:

Model:
- None

View:
- Modify the ExpenseTrackerView class so that each transaction row can
be clicked. Then, add an event handler method to the ExpenseTrackerApp
so a method from ExpenseTrackerController is called.

Controller:
- Add a method so that once you click on a transaction, it will call the 
removeTransaction method from the ExpenseTrackerModel class. Then, it will
call the refreshTable function within the ExpenseTrackerView class, which
will also update the total cost.
